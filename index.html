            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <h4>Planning Assistant</h4>
            <h4 class="exp-duration">July 2018 to September 2018</h4>
            <h4>ID Construction Ltd <span class="location">- Hanam-si, Gyeonggi-do</span></h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Conducted research and analysis to estimate the profitability of a factory construction in Hwaseong-si based on the request of landowner</li>
                <li>With the help of local real estate agency partners my team estimated the market price of other land in the vicinity</li>
                <li>Worked out the present value of the factory that can be constructed with annual interest rate at that time and thus evaluate the net present value which turned out to be negative</li>
                <li>Whilst measuring present value of the factory, my team considered various aspects including the potentiality of the related industries, competitiveness of and accessibility to the region, and the switchability of the use of the factory, from which I learnt how to approximate and quantify those factors</li>
                <li>Considered local regulation – for a factory to be constructed enough entrance road (at least two lines of roads for cars) width should exist where only one line was there and thus entrance should be expanded to some extent which incurs significant costs</li>
                <li>Monitored multiple databases(other factory prices in the vicinity, the number of newly built factories in the region to assess demand level etc.) to correctly calculate land price and predict present value of the factory that will be constructed</li>
